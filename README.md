# ~~librazermacos~~

~~The driver code from [razer-macos](https://github.com/1kc/razer-macos), in the form of a dynamic library.~~

## Archived
The day after this repository was created, the razer-macos maintainer did the same thing. Make was used instead of the (nicer IMHO) CMake, but that's hardly a reason to maintain a separate project like this.
